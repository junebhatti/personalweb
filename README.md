# Personal site

Junaid Bhatti's personal website. Astro, statically generated, no client-side JavaScript.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:4321`. `npm run build` writes the static site to `dist/`.

## Adding content

Writing and notes are Markdown files. Drop a new file in the right directory and it appears on
its index page, sorted newest first, with its own page at `/writing/<filename>` or `/notes/<filename>`.

Writing — `src/content/writing/some-title.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Some title
date: 2026-04-03
---

First paragraph.

Second paragraph.
```

Notes have no title; the body is the entry:

```markdown
---
date: 2026-08-05
---

The note text.
```

Projects and videos are still hardcoded arrays at the top of `src/pages/projects.astro` and
`src/pages/videos.astro`. Coursework, favorites, and interests are written directly into their
own page files.

## Layout

```
src/
  content/writing/   long-form posts (title + date)
  content/notes/     short-form notes (date only)
  pages/             one file per route
  layouts/Base.astro shared html shell
  styles/global.css  the entire stylesheet
```

Design tokens — colors, type scale, spacing — live at the top of `global.css`. There is one
stylesheet on purpose.
